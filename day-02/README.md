# Day 02 – Tip Calculator

## Overview

My second Python program from Angela Yu's course. A practical tip calculator that helps split bills among multiple people.

## What I Learned

- `print()` - Displaying output
- `input()` - Getting user input
- Variables - Storing data (bill, tip, people)
- Type conversion - `float()` and `int()`
- Mathematical operations - division, multiplication, addition
- `round()` - Rounding decimal numbers
- f-strings - Formatted string output

## How It Works

1. Asks for the total bill amount
2. Asks for the tip percentage (10, 12, or 15)
3. Asks how many people are splitting the bill
4. Calculates the total bill including tip
5. Divides the total by number of people
6. Rounds to 2 decimal places and displays the result

## Run

```bash
python task.py
```
